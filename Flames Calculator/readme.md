#FLAMES Calculator

FLAMES is a popular game that stands for Friends, Lovers, Affection, Marriage, Enemies, and Siblings. Itâ€™s a fun way to predict the relationship outcome based on the names of two individuals. This project is a simple implementation of the FLAMES game calculator that takes two names as input and gives a result based on the FLAMES logic.


#Features

Calculate the FLAMES outcome based on two names.

User-friendly interface to input names.

Results include: Friends, Lovers, Affection, Marriage, Enemies, and Siblings.

Fun and interactive!


##How it works

Input Names: The user enters two names to calculate their FLAMES result.

FLAMES Logic: Based on the characters in the names, the FLAMES algorithm works by eliminating letters and reducing the count progressively until a final relationship result is obtained.

Result: The result will show one of the following categories: Friends, Lovers, Affection, Marriage, Enemies, or Siblings.
