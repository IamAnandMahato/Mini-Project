This project is a simple web-based CAPTCHA generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It creates a random alphanumeric CAPTCHA code and provides a text input field for users to enter the code. This functionality helps to distinguish between human users and automated bots.

🧩 Features
Random CAPTCHA generation using letters and numbers

CAPTCHA regeneration button

User input verification

Basic styling for a clean and responsive layout

Pure frontend (no backend or external libraries)

🚀 How It Works
When the page loads, a random CAPTCHA is generated using JavaScript.

The CAPTCHA is displayed in a styled container using CSS.

The user enters the displayed code into an input field.

On submission, the input is checked against the generated CAPTCHA.

Feedback is shown whether the input is correct or not.

A "Reload CAPTCHA" button lets the user generate a new code.
